Was reading about ANNs in 1991 whilst messing about with 'expert' systems, then the winter came and I went into hibernation.

With the advent of spring I eventually, and tentatively, began coming out of my slumber.

And now, presently, I'm rubbing my eyes in bewilderment and wondering what the hell is going on.

Cheers.
